# PyQt5-GUI-ML
Machine Learning First Project

## This was our project for Rajasthan Hackathon 2018 

### We  made a machine learning project(ConcreteML) for Civil Engineering field which will have great impact from future point of view. The Project is Based on Deep Learning (ANN), Tkinter(Python ), Random Forest, Data Manipulation and Visulazation and provides excellent performance in terms of accuracy.

* For these to be run we require Python3.6, R 3.4.1, Tkinter 8.6,PyQt5.
